Py-Launcher is a fork of PRAW-RT and it allows users to use any python scrips they want. It allows users to add, name, view, and remove scripts easily within the program. It allows users to open all their script files at once at set intervals. In the future the option to open certain scripts at different set intervals will be implemented.
